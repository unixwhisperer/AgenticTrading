**[Agentic Trading Lab](https://agentic-trading-lab.vercel.app/) is an open-source experimental platform for LLM-powered trading agents.**  
Turn trading ideas into traceable experiments: prototype agents, run backtests and paper-trading simulations, inspect reasoning and decision logs, benchmark against market baselines, and study how agents behave under near-real financial constraints.

## Overview

Agentic Trading Lab is an interactive research and educational platform for exploring trading systems powered by large language models. Developed alongside a systematic survey of agentic trading research, it helps students, researchers, and developers explore how agents reason, trade, and perform in realistic market environments. Move beyond backtest returns by customizing agents, inspecting their decisions, evaluating risk, progressing from historical simulation to live-market paper trading, and comparing performance on standardized leaderboards.

## Key Features

***Talk to agents. Test trading ideas.***
Start with a market question or trading idea, then turn it into an agent you can run, observe, and improve.

- **Create trading agents your way**  
Choose a model, data source, and trading prompt, or connect your own agent through our API.
- **Start from a template**  
Add a ready-made agent from the Community tab, then customize its prompts and backtest it.
- **Build an agent-powered portfolio**  
Give multiple agents simulated capital and manage them as your own virtual trading team.
- **Test before using real capital**  
Move from historical backtests to live-market paper trading in one workflow.
- **Go live when you're ready**  
Connect a real Robinhood account and let an agent trade it under per-order risk caps. Off by default, with a review-only mode that shows what an agent *would* do before it can act — see [Live Trading](docs/source/lab/live_trading.rst).
- **See every run, decision, and reason**  
Monitor positions, trades, portfolio changes, and the reasoning behind each action.
- **Measure more than returns**  
Evaluate performance, risk, drawdown, and trading behavior using standardized metrics.
- **Compare agents in the open**  
Benchmark LLM models, baseline strategies, and market indices on an open leaderboard under the same market window.

## Run Locally

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=180 uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt -r requirements-vnpy.txt pytest pytest-timeout
dashboard/scripts/run_local_safe.sh        # http://127.0.0.1:8765/app, no keys, nothing can trade or bill
```

## User Workflow

## Roadmap

Agentic Trading Lab is evolving from an experimental playground into an open platform where trading agents, models, data, and tools can be connected, managed, evaluated, and reused.

- **Standardized agent integration**  
Define reusable Agent Cards, manifests, runners, trace schemas, and evaluator hooks for connecting agents to the Lab.
- **Broader agent and tool connectivity**  
Connect popular open-source trading projects, model providers, data providers, brokers, and external agents through adapters, SDKs, and MCP.
- **Managed agent runtime**  
Support scheduled and long-running agents with persistent state, monitoring, alerts, and failure recovery.
- **Dynamic market evaluation**  
Evaluate agents through live-market paper trading with execution records, costs, risks, and reasoning traces—not only final returns.
- **Risk and stress testing**  
Test agents under changing market conditions with configurable risk policies, approval rules, and kill switches.
- **Open agent ecosystem**  
Grow Agent Cards, reproducible submissions, competitions, and the open leaderboard toward hundreds and eventually thousands of reusable agent instances.

Progress so far: news sentiment is live via Agentic FinSearch (Home panel + v2 agent context), with Reddit/social sentiment still planned. Under *Broader agent and tool connectivity*, the first external-framework adapter has shipped — [TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents) runs locally on your own model and data credentials and replays its decisions through the Python SDK ([setup guide](docs/integrations/tradingagents.zh-CN.md), written in Simplified Chinese) — while MCP, broker, and data-provider adapters are still ahead.
