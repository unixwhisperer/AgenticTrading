"""LLM trading agent as a leaderboard baseline.

Replays the hourly DJIA backtest over the contest window, asking an LLM
(e.g. Claude Haiku 4.5) for buy/sell/hold decisions each market hour. Every
model on the leaderboard is just a config entry with a different ``model_id`` —
the trading logic is shared and lives in ``backtest_hourly_agent``.

Unlike the deterministic baselines, this strategy makes real LLM API calls, so
it is expensive and slow. It is intended to be precomputed by the deploy script
(``scripts/deploy_leaderboard_model.py``) and cached, not recomputed on every
web request. It records token usage / cost so cost can be shown per run.
