"""Agent-Environment Protocol orchestration (Run API service layer).

This is a thin adapter over the existing external backtest engine
(``external_backtest_service``). It exposes the generalized Run/Step/Decision/
ExecutionResult protocol while delegating all data loading, validation,
execution and persistence to the engine and ``llm_validator``. It adds:

* stable, immutable step IDs over the engine's single mutable "current step",
* idempotency keys and per-step finalization guards,
* protocol-shaped Observation / ExecutionResult payloads,
* a simple run/step state machine and clear deadline errors.

Moved verbatim (Phase 3B1) from ``dashboard/backend/run_service.py``; the
original module was removed in Phase 4A. Public functions, ``ProtocolRun``,
module-level registries, signatures, and behavior are unchanged; only the module
location moved (and the ``run_store`` import now points at the canonical
repository).
