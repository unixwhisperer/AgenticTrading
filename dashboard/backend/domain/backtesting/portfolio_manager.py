"""Backtesting portfolio-manager orchestration facade.

Moved (Phase 2C3) from ``dashboard/scripts/backtest_hourly_agent.py`` during the
domain-layer extraction. ``PortfolioManager`` coordinates the backtest agent:
portfolio state/valuation, deterministic reference-agent decisions, the LLM
decision workflow, in-memory execution, equity history, and token counters. The
lower-level logic already lives under ``dashboard.backend.domain.trading`` and
``dashboard.backend.infrastructure.llm``; this class delegates to it.

Most of the class is a mechanical move (only the imports became canonical), and
the legacy script re-exports this exact class object so ``bha.PortfolioManager``
and existing subclasses keep working unchanged. **The trading logic is not fully
unchanged, though:** the ``safe_trading`` candidate selection in
``make_trading_decision_with_llm`` no longer ranks the top-10 candidates by RSI
extremity (``|RSI - 50|``, a mean-reversion heuristic) — it ranks the top-12 by a
multi-factor trend/momentum score *and always appends current holdings*. That
ranking change was made separately from (and independently of) this file's
domain-layer move, so backtests from before it are **not** directly comparable
with current ones (see the inline comment on that branch for the rationale).

This module is domain-level orchestration: it must NOT import dashboard scripts,
``HourlyBacktester``, FastAPI routers, the database singleton, or Alpaca clients.
