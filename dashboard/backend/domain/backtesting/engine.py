"""Profile-driven hourly backtest engine.

Moved verbatim (Phase 2C5) from ``dashboard/scripts/backtest_hourly_agent.py``.
``HourlyBacktester`` runs the hourly agent backtest plus the configured buy-and-hold
and optional index baselines, persisting results to the database. The class body is functionally
identical to the legacy implementation; only the imports are canonical. The
legacy script re-exports this exact class so ``bha.HourlyBacktester`` and existing
subclasses (e.g. ``backtest_custom_algo``) keep working unchanged.

This module is backend domain code: it must NOT import dashboard scripts,
``backtest_hourly_agent``, FastAPI routers, or the CLI bootstrap helpers.

Baseline methods and result assembly intentionally remain here for now; they can
be extracted in a later phase.

from datetime import date, datetime
from math import ceil
# `from time import ...`, not `import time`. This module used to import
# `datetime.time` too, to build the A-share session bounds inline, and the two
# bare `time` names shadowed each other depending on import order -- green on
# every US run, red only on an A-share one. The bounds now live in
# `market_data.sessions`, but keep the aliased form so re-adding either import
# cannot bring the collision back.
#
# Two clocks, deliberately. `wall_clock` stamps INSTANTS an operator or another
# process reads -- `started_at`/`ended_at` in `phases[]`, which are compared
# against `--launched-at` and the two stamps the launch script takes. `steady`
# measures DURATIONS, because `time.time()` is not monotonic: an NTP step
# between two reads distorts the interval and a backward step makes it
# negative, and these numbers are published on the card and are the measurement
# the next latency decision is made on.
#
# `starting` is the one phase whose TOTAL cannot move to `steady`, and not for
# a reason worth working around: `monotonic()` has a per-process epoch, so the
# parent's reading and the child's are not comparable at all. That phase opens
# at the parent's `--launched-at` and closes in the child, so the wall clock is
# the only shared reference. It is also the interval least exposed to the
# hazard: a single span bounded by a process spawn, not a loop.
#
# Its SPLITS are not all like that, and reading "the phase is cross-process" as
# "every number under it is" is how the fix for #509 first shipped with two
# wall-clock differences still in it. Only `spawn+interpreter` reaches back
# into the parent; `imports+stores` and `preflight` both begin and end inside
# the child, so both take the steady clock -- bounded by the two `monotonic()`
# marks the launch script hands over in `startup_clock`. See
# `_set_progress_phase`.

    silently show the oldest 200 orders of a run that placed thousands.

    # before it, nothing wrote anything, and the card sat on its launch
    # sentence for the whole start (imports, six stores' DDL, the bar fetch,
    # aggregation, indicators, then bar 1's full pipeline). Each phase write
    # carries the phase in progress plus the finished ones with timestamps, so
    # the same payload that drives the card is the measurement of the start.
    # Every accessor tolerates an instance built with __new__ (tests, legacy
    # tools) that never ran _init_progress_phases -- and `publish_phase`
    # additionally tolerates `progress_file` being *absent* rather than None,
    # because Step 6 makes it the first statement of `load_data`, which is
    # documented as usable on exactly such an instance.

    def _init_progress_phases(
        self,
        launched_at: Optional[float] = None,
        startup_clock: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None,

        """Open the implicit `starting` phase at the parent's launch time.

        The parent alone can see the gap between spawning the child and the
        child's first write (imports, store startup); passing its clock in is
        how that gap becomes a measured phase instead of a missing one. A
        caller that passes nothing (the CLI without --launched-at, tests,
        `__new__` instances) opens no phase at all, so the first
        `publish_phase` records no `starting` entry rather than inventing one
        from the child's own clock -- which would measure zero and read as a
        start that cost nothing.

        `starting` is deliberately ONE phase name -- the card has nothing
        useful to say about spawn vs imports vs stores, and a name the status
        route must translate is a name the frontend must learn. But one
        undifferentiated number cannot justify an optimisation either: it lumps
        process spawn, pandas and three SDK imports, seven store constructions
        (six of them Postgres twins, and only those six run DDL) and that DDL
        into a single figure that moves for reasons nobody can attribute. So
        the *record* is split even though the *phase* is not.
        With the script's two stamps and its reading of db_url's accumulator,
        the `starting` entry yields four numbers from one run:

            spawn + interpreter    = child_entered_at - started_at
            imports incl. stores   = imports_seconds       (steady clock)
            of which schema DDL    = schema_init_seconds   (0.0 in a worker)
            preflight remainder    = preflight_seconds     (steady clock)

        The middle two are measured, not re-derived from the stamps beside
        them: both intervals begin and end inside the child, so both belong on
        the steady clock for the reason the module header gives. The stamps
        stay because `spawn + interpreter` genuinely needs them and because
        they are what a log line is correlated against.

        Undo the split and the Final verification table can say that `starting`
        got shorter but not which of those four moved -- which is the same as
        not knowing whether removing the DDL did anything.

        A mark nobody passed is *absent*, not zero: an in-process engine gets a
        plain three-key record. `schema_init_seconds` is the one exception --
        present and 0.0 in a worker, because that zero is the evidence the flag
        fired, not a gap.

        only the message and the bar count change.

        a second, independent guard in the browser for any writer that still
        publishes a bare phase tick after real progress; neither is a substitute
