"""Technical indicator feature computation.

Extracted (Phase 2A) from ``TechnicalIndicators`` in
``dashboard/scripts/backtest_hourly_agent.py``. Feature names, dataframe column
names, indicator parameters, and the returned dataframe shape are preserved.

The whole backtest window arrives at once, so every indicator is computed
causally: a row depends only on the closes at or before it, never on the
closes after it or on how many bars follow it. A row takes the pandas-ta value
only once its own prefix is long enough for pandas-ta to answer (``_GROUPS``);
earlier rows, rows the library leaves empty, and groups the library failed to
produce use causal fallbacks -- neutral RSI (50) and MACD (0), and for the
SMAs and Bollinger Bands the library's own formula with ``min_periods=1``: the
mean (+/- 2 sample standard deviations) of the closes seen so far during
warm-up, and of the indicator's window once it is full. Non-numeric and
non-finite closes count as missing; SMA and band columns are NaN only on rows
whose window holds no usable close.
