"""Background baseline generation with config-level dedup (T2).

Baselines (buy-hold + DJIA) depend only on the run *config*, not the agent, so
a wave of same-config finalizes needs exactly one baseline pair. Finalize
enqueues a job here and returns; one lazily-started daemon thread drains the
queue (single consumer — the dedup cache therefore needs no lock: job N for a
config fully completes, DB write included, before job N+1 dequeues).

Degradation semantics match today's best-effort baselines: a full queue drops
the job with a printed error (the run stays completed without baselines), a
failure is printed and swallowed, and jobs are lost on process restart —
identical durability to the old in-request path, which lost baselines on a
mid-finalize restart too.

Each job carries a direct reference to its dataset's ``all_data`` (the T1
bundle), so LRU eviction between enqueue and drain can never force a
refetch/rebuild storm; same-config jobs share one object, bounding pinned
memory by the distinct configs in the queue.

``publish`` callbacks must swap in a NEW dict (never mutate one the session
already exposed) — see ExternalBacktestSession._publish_baselines.
