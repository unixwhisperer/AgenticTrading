"""Shared, immutable market-data datasets for backtest sessions (T1).

One dataset (indicator-enriched decision bars + source bars + trading
timestamps + price caches) per ``(symbols, start_date, end_date,
source_timeframe, decision_timeframe, equity_metadata_source, market)`` key,
shared by every session with that config. ``symbols`` is a sorted set and
``market`` is canonical, so the same universe in a different order, with a
repeat, or with the market spelled ``"us"`` is one entry and not two -- and the
dataset is built in that same sorted order, so which caller happened to build
first cannot change what a later one receives. READ-ONLY CONTRACT: every
consumer treats the dataset frames, timestamps and caches as immutable —
verified convention across the engine, baselines, and PortfolioManager. Never
mutate a dataset.

Concurrency model (deliberately NOT cache.py's coordinator, whose followers
never block): the first requester for a key builds; concurrent requesters
block on a ``threading.Event`` and receive the same object. A build failure
propagates to every waiter and is negative-cached for ``NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS``
so a dead upstream doesn't trigger a retry stampede.

LOCK RULE: ``get_dataset`` may block for a full Alpaca fetch — it must only be
called from loader threads, NEVER while holding the run-creation lock.
``peek`` is non-blocking and is the only entry point allowed under that lock.
