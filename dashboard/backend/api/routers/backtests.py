"""Backtest, run, and comparison routes (Phase 3D4A).

Moved verbatim from ``dashboard/backend/app.py``. All external paths
(``/backtest/*``, ``/api/backtest/*``, ``/runs*``, ``/compare``), methods,
endpoint names, response models, market-hours filtering, and the background
backtest workflow are unchanged. This router is registered directly on the app
(routes carry their full absolute paths; no extra prefix is applied), so the
``/api/backtest/...`` paths remain exactly as before.

The decorator order is preserved so that ``/api/backtest/compare/latest`` is
registered before ``/api/backtest/{run_id}`` and ``/runs/latest/metrics`` before
``/runs/{run_id}``.

# loaded bar window.
#
# This number was sized against a 512MB free instance. Prod moved to Render
# Standard (1 CPU / 2GB) on 2026-09-11, which raised the capacity ceiling
# without establishing where it now sits: nothing has ever measured one
# child's resident set, and the ~1.1GB of headroom above the observed 882MB
# peak belongs to the *instance*, shared across however many slots this value
# opens -- it is not 1.1GB per child. So RAM is not ruled out as the constraint
# here; it has only stopped being the obviously binding one.
#
# The bound that can be reasoned about without a measurement is *spend*.
# Before this module grew slots the runner was single-flight and the ceiling
# was exactly 1, so a larger value here multiplies operator API cost by the
# same factor. Raising this therefore wants both -- a budget decision *and* a
# profiled per-run footprint -- rather than either one alone.

    ``error``: a cancel is the owner's own deliberate action, and reporting it
    back to them as a failure is the same class of lie as reporting a run the
    model never drove as a clean success (issue #169, the change this one
    stacks on). The status route branches on it, and the analytics event below
    is ``backtest_cancelled`` rather than ``backtest_failed`` for the same
    reason -- a dashboard that counts cancels as failures measures the product
    as broken every time a user changes their mind.

    ``timed_out`` is the fourth, and it is neither of the other two. Not a
    cancel: the user did nothing, and telling them they stopped their own run
    is a different lie in the same family. Not a crash: nothing threw -- the
    product ran out of the wall-clock budget it set itself, and billed them for
    the model calls that settled before it did. So ``error`` stays None here
    (routing it through ``error`` lands in the existing error branch and
    nothing on screen changes), the user-facing outcome is its own status
    branch, and the analytics event below stays ``backtest_failed`` with
    ``error_category="run_timeout"`` -- because unlike a cancel, a timeout IS a
    failure, and moving it out of that event would quietly lift timeouts out of
    the success-rate KPI.

    ``timeout_detail`` is facts only -- budget, lane, spend, call count -- never
    a sentence. The client composes the copy so the copy register can see it.

    for why one rule could not serve both a read and a stop. An unknown id and
    another caller's id raise the SAME 404: a session id is an access grant in
    this codebase (see ``_owner_context``), so a distinguishable refusal would
    let this route be used first to test whether a run id exists and then to
    learn whose it is.

    * ``accepted`` is False when the run already reached a terminal state. The
      caller must not invent a cancel for it — issue #273 asks specifically
      that a completed-but-not-yet-detected run is not turned into a spurious
      outcome, and fabricating one here is exactly how that happens.
    * ``process`` is None when the worker has not launched its child yet;
      ``_attach_backtest_process`` turns that into a kill at launch rather than
      an orphaned subprocess.

    The legacy ``backtest_status`` mirror is deliberately NOT consulted, unlike
    in ``_resolve_status_slot``. A run that exists only in the mirror never
    registered a slot, so it has no child handle and no quota to release —
    answering 200 for it would report a cancel that cannot have happened.

    The finalize runs here rather than in the worker so the owner's concurrency
    quota is freed the moment the request is accepted, instead of whenever the

# ============================================================================
# AI Hedge Fund window bound (issue #308)
# ============================================================================
#
# The hosted runtime spends one upstream *subprocess per trading day*, each
# loading its own lookback window and analyst graph beside a parent already
# holding uvicorn, FastAPI and the Postgres pools. The kernel's victim is the
# whole web process, so one backtest denies service to every user until a
# replacement instance is healthy — and since PR #451 a backtest is the
# onboarding task, where a new user gets exactly one pass.
#
# Issue #308's own framing is that this is a hosting-capacity failure rather
# than an application bug, and its acceptance criteria are alternatives: raise
# the instance's RAM, isolate the runtime into its own service, document it as
# unsupported, or REFUSE the run with a clear error. This bound is the refusal.
#
# **The RAM exit was taken on 2026-09-11**: prod moved from a 512MB free
# instance to Render Standard (1 CPU / 2GB). The Render API records six
# ``oomKilled`` events at ``memoryLimit: 512Mi`` between 2026-09-08 and
# 2026-09-10 and none since. Measured on the new plan: ~300MB idle, 882MB
# observed peak — though that peak was taken *on 2GB*, where nothing pressures
# the allocator to stay small, so it bounds what the app wants rather than what
# it needs. Above it sits ~1.1GB of headroom, and that figure is the **whole
# instance's**: ``MAX_ACTIVE_DASHBOARD_BACKTESTS`` admits several concurrent
# ``POST /backtest/run`` runs (five by default), and this window bound is
# enforced in that same handler -- so the 1.1GB is shared across every
# in-flight run plus the parent. Do not read it as a per-child budget.
#
# The default below stays at 10 regardless, because nothing here has ever
# measured one child's resident set. 10 was itself a guess against the old
# ceiling, and replacing it with a larger guess against a larger ceiling is the
# same mistake with more RAM behind it. Profile one child's peak RSS first,
# then raise it from the Render dashboard — it is env-overridable precisely so
# that needs no deploy.
#
# 0 disables the hosted runtime outright — the same meaning
# ``MAX_ACTIVE_DASHBOARD_BACKTESTS`` gives 0 — so an operator on constrained
# hosting can turn it off from the Render dashboard without a deploy.

# ============================================================================
# Pipeline LLM window preflight (issue #474, item 1)
# ============================================================================
#
# The hosted guard above can invert its own budget because the hosted path
# ENFORCES a per-step timeout: _backtest_subprocess_timeout multiplies
# resolve_step_timeout_seconds() by a day count, and
# _ai_hedge_fund_trading_days_ceiling() inverts that same product, which is why
# its docstring can say the bound and the budget cannot disagree.
#
# Nothing enforces a per-bar ceiling on the pipeline path. run_pipeline_decision
# issues one model call per pipeline decision step per hourly bar, each with up
# to one retry, and the only wall-clock bound is per provider attempt:
# LLM_PROVIDER_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (180s by default,
# infrastructure/llm/execution/adapters/base.py), with one more attempt when a
# Platform Credits call fails over to the next candidate. (Until 2026-09-28 this
# said "the 60s httpx read timeout"; the SDKs' silent retries made that ~185s
# and three billed generations.) A refusal built on that worst case --
# 3000 / (180 * 2 candidates * 2 attempts) = about 4 bars, under one trading
# day -- would refuse essentially every run. So the number below is a
# CALIBRATED ESTIMATE of typical per-call latency, not an inverted ceiling, and
# the 3600s timeout stays the real backstop: a slow reasoning model can still
# exhaust the budget and be killed.
# What this preflight removes is the obviously uncompletable case, before any
# spend and while the user still has the dates on screen.
#
# ⚠ The safe direction is INVERTED relative to _backtest_subprocess_timeout.
# That function over-provisions on purpose, because it sizes a BUDGET. This one
# computes a REFUSAL: under-estimating the work lets a marginal run through and
# the timeout catches it, while over-estimating refuses a run that would have
# succeeded -- on the declared onboarding task, where a new user gets one pass.
# Do not "tighten" these estimates toward the worst case.

# Hourly decision bars in one trading day, by market.
#
# US is the widest session: ``_market_hours_only`` keeps roughly 09:30 through
# 16:00. CN runs two shorter ones (09:30-11:30 and 13:00-15:00) and costs four.
#
# This was ONE number for both, taken from the wider market, on the reasoning
# that a per-profile table here would be a second place for the bar cadence to
# be wrong. That reasoning was right about the risk and wrong about the remedy:
# billing CN at seven bars overstates an A-share run by ~75%, and this guard
# computes a REFUSAL, so overstating refuses runs that would have finished --
# the direction the banner above explicitly tells us not to move in. The
# shipped A-share prefill (11 trading days) with a three-step pipeline
# estimated 11 x 7 x 3 = 231 calls against a 200 budget and 422'd; its true
# cost is 11 x 4 x 3 = 132.
#
# The duplication worry is answered by not duplicating: the CN number is
# imported from ``infrastructure/market_data/ifind_ashare.py``, where the same
# four-bar session already backs ``minimum_bars_for_window``. There is one
# literal here, for the US default, and markets without their own session
# constant fall back to it -- still the wider market, so still the conservative
# answer for anything unrecognised.
