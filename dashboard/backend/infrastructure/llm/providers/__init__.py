"""Parallel LLM gateway integrations for the trading / leaderboard pipeline.

Each integration is a sibling module exposing the same surface:

* ``INTEGRATION_ID`` — config value for ``leaderboard.json`` ``integration``
* ``DEFAULT_MODEL`` / ``default_model_name()``
* ``make_client(anthropic_cls, *, reasoning_effort=None)`` → a client exposing
  Anthropic-shaped ``messages.create`` (the response a Messages client
  returns), or ``None`` when the key is missing. Most are Anthropic SDK
  clients; CommonStack with thinking off speaks chat completions behind the
  same surface. An effort the integration cannot send raises
  ``UnsupportedReasoningEffort`` rather than being dropped.

Callers pick a gateway via ``make_llm_client(integration=...)`` (explicit) or
omit it for legacy env auto-detect (CommonStack key → CommonStack, else native
Anthropic). OpenRouter is never auto-selected — set ``integration: "openrouter"``
on the leaderboard entry (or pass the kwarg).
