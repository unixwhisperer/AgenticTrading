# A-share cash equities trade four 60m bars a session: 09:30-11:30 and
# 13:00-15:00. The floor below is expressed against that, not as a flat count.
#
# Public because the pipeline call-volume preflight in
# ``api/routers/backtests.py`` asks the same question -- how many decision bars
# does one trading day cost on this market -- and answering it with its own
# literal is what made that guard refuse legal A-share windows: it billed CN at
# the US session's seven bars, overstating a three-step pipeline by ~75%.

# Half the weekday-derived expectation. It has to absorb exchange holidays --
# Qingming and Labour Day both fall inside the windows this universe ships
# with -- and a weekday count cannot see them, so a stricter fraction would
# refuse good data every May. Half still catches the failure this guard exists
# for: an empty, one-day, or wholesale-truncated upstream reply.
#
# ⚠ Half is calibrated against the one- and two-day closures, and it does NOT
# cover the week-long ones. National Day (Oct 1-7) and Spring Festival each
# shut the exchange for most of a trading week, so a window that is legal
# under MAX_BACKTEST_DAYS and whose data is perfectly good can still land
# under this floor and be refused as incomplete -- a false refusal, not a
# missed detection, so it fails in the safe direction and says so loudly
# rather than charting a short curve as real. The honest fix is a CN trading
# calendar, which this module deliberately does not carry: inventing one here
# would put a second, unversioned holiday table in the codebase next to the
# exchange's own. Lowering the fraction instead would trade a visible false
# refusal for a silent acceptance of a genuinely truncated reply, which is
# the trade this guard exists to refuse. Tracked as a follow-up on #474.

    Derived from the requested half-open window rather than fixed, because a
    flat count is simultaneously a hidden minimum window (it was 50, i.e. ~13
    trading days) and unreachable once MAX_BACKTEST_DAYS fell to 14. That
    bound limits ``end - start`` to 14 days and the window includes its
    end date, so a run spans up to 15 calendar days: at most 11 weekdays,
    or 44 bars. ``end`` here is the provider's half-open bound, one day on.

    Public because the same depth question is asked twice on this path, at two
    layers: here, against one upstream response, and again in
    ``domain/backtesting/engine.py``'s ``_validate_ifind_loaded_data``, against
    the assembled per-symbol frames. Both used to hardcode 50 independently,
    which is how the second one outlived the first being fixed.
