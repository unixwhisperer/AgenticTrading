"""Pre-fetch the default backtest windows into the on-disk bar cache.

A cold instance otherwise charges the first visitor the full bar fetch, which
is precisely the user this cache exists for. Runs on a daemon thread from
``app.py``'s startup hook -- the PARENT web process, never a backtest child
(a child never runs ``app.py``, so there is nothing to suppress there).

Cost, named rather than discovered later: three batched Alpaca calls per
deploy, and merging to ``main`` auto-deploys prod via the CI hook. Negligible
quota, but it is a new recurring outbound call -- which is why
``ATL_BAR_CACHE_WARM`` is **strict opt-in** and this module does nothing until
an operator sets it. Default-on billed the Docker image, every fork and
self-host, and every ``uvicorn --reload`` save on a developer machine holding
keys. A failure is logged and swallowed -- a cold cache is the status quo,
not an outage.

This module is separate from ``bar_cache`` for one reason: it imports
``AlpacaDataLoader``, which imports ``bar_cache``. Keeping the loader out of
``bar_cache`` is what keeps that dependency one-directional.
