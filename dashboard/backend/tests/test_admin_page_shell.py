    as well as a route: if some element carries the same id, the browser scrolls
    it to the top of the viewport on click, dragging the header and the ticker
    off screen, and it does so before `route()` is reached.

    `route()` ends with `window.scrollTo(0, 0)`, which hides the damage whenever

    every test here, because the sections `<section id="overview">` and
