"""Parity between each SQLite store and its Postgres twin.

Every dual-backend store is selected by a factory at import time, and the
service layer calls one interface against whichever twin got built. Two
independent ways a twin can diverge both surface only on prod:

* **Call signature.** Callers pass sentinel kwargs (``_UNSET``) on every call,
  so a parameter that exists on the SQLite store but not the Postgres twin is
  not a feature gap -- it is a ``TypeError`` raised before any SQL runs, on
  every call to that method. A method missing from the twin outright is the
  same defect one step worse (``AttributeError``).
* **Table schema.** ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` silently no-ops once the
  table exists, so a column added to only one twin -- or added to the twin's
  ``CREATE`` but not to an ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` --
  leaves every query naming it raising ``UndefinedColumn``. Both halves are
  checked: the twins must declare the same columns, *and* the Postgres twin
  must repeat every lazy migration the SQLite store performs (declaring a
  column in ``CREATE`` alone reaches a fresh database but never a deployed
  one, which is the failure mode the twin's own header comment warns about).
* **Index order.** The same no-op bites a ``CREATE INDEX`` that names a
  column the twin only adds by ``ALTER TABLE`` further down: on a deployed
  table the index runs first and raises ``UndefinedColumn`` at import (#432
  killed the Render boot this way). Each index must sit below every ADD
  COLUMN it depends on.

#227 hit the first axis: it added ``live_trading_enabled`` to
``AgentStore.update_agent`` only, and every agent Configure PATCH on prod
500'd bare (an unhandled exception escapes CORSMiddleware, so browsers
reported it as a CORS block) while the SQLite-backed test suite stayed green.
It hit the second axis too -- the column was missing from the Postgres table
-- which would have been the *next* 500 had the kwarg alone been fixed.

Both checks are static: signatures come from ``inspect``, columns from
parsing the module source. Neither needs a live Postgres, so this tier stays
active where the @pg_only behavioral tier fails open (TEST_POSTGRES_URL
unset -- local dev and any CI lane without the service container;
test_ci_postgres_wired.py asserts CI itself never lands in that state).

Imports happen inside the test bodies, not at collection: the registry below
is plain strings, so an import error here fails one test rather than erroring
collection and aborting the whole session.

# Absence-direction check: a dialect branch outside a registered twin
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The registry above and the rglob discovery test are both existence-first:
# they start from a *_postgres.py file or a _TWINS entry and check it is
# complete. Neither can catch a class that branches SQLite-vs-Postgres
# inline -- exactly what ValueAnalyticsStore did until PR T -- because such
# a class owns no *_postgres.py file to discover. This test starts from the
# other end: every occurrence of the two known dialect-branch idioms --
# `is_postgres`, and a `hasattr` check for `database_url` -- across every
# non-test module under dashboard/backend. Each hit is a twin extraction
# that has not happened yet, a non-twin helper reading a table a registered
# twin already owns, or a deliberate branch on some *other* store's dialect.
# All three need a name below with a reason -- silence here is exactly how
# ValueAnalyticsStore's 21 branches went unnoticed for as long as they did.
#
# Registered *_postgres.py twins are scanned too, and deliberately so. They
# were exempt until the fix for PR #498's review: being a registered twin
# says the file is the Postgres *side* of a pair, which is no reason for it
# to contain a dialect *branch* -- a well-formed twin just writes `%s` and
# tests nothing. The exemption meant value_repository_postgres.py's own
# branches needed no reason while the identical ones in its SQLite twin got
# a long one, and it left the single blind spot this whole test exists to
# close: a genuinely missing extraction added inside a registered twin.
#
# The match is textual, not semantic, and that limit is worth stating rather
# than leaving a reader to assume otherwise: a branch written a third way --
# an `isinstance(store, PostgresAnalyticsStore)` test, a
# `getattr(store, "database_url", None)` default -- evades this scan. Both
# matched forms are what every dialect branch in the tree uses today, so
# this guard covers the established idiom; it is not a proof that no
# dialect branch can ever hide again.
#
# The allowlist below is keyed by *file*, which bounds it the same way: a
# new dialect branch added to a file that already has an entry trips
# neither assertion -- not `unlisted`, because the file is listed, and not
# `stale`, because the file still has hits. Only a branch in an unlisted
# file is caught. A per-entry hit count would close that and is deliberately
# not used: it churns on every unrelated edit to these files, so it would be
# updated reflexively and stop meaning anything. What each reason can do
# instead is name the branching symbols, as `backfill.py`'s does.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Axis 4: method bodies duplicated across a twin pair
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every axis above compares *shape* -- signatures, columns, index order --
# because shape is cheap to compare. What actually drifts is behaviour. A
# method copied verbatim into both twins has no dialect difference to justify
# it, so the next fix applied to one copy and not the other ships a
# Postgres-only behaviour divergence with a fully green suite: the signature
# axis still matches, the column axis still matches, and nothing reads a body.
#
# PR T is what made this worth guarding. Extracting PostgresValueAnalyticsStore
# duplicated 321 lines across five methods holding no SQL and no dialect
# branching of their own -- more than every other twin in this registry
# combined, the next largest being 17 lines -- because that split was
# deliberately scoped to "change no query". The duplication is therefore a
# known, accepted cost, not an oversight; what was missing is anything that
# notices when a copy stops matching.
#
# The declaration below is deliberately two-way, and that is what keeps it
# from rotting the way a one-way allowlist does:
#
#   * A declared method whose two copies stop matching fails as a divergence
#     -- the behaviour drift above, caught at the commit that introduces it.
#   * A method that *becomes* identical without being declared fails as new
#     duplication, so a twin cannot quietly accumulate more copied code than
#     it admits to.
#
# Comparison is `ast.unparse`, not source text: it ignores comments and
# formatting and compares the code that actually runs. Two copies that differ
# only in a comment are still one behaviour in two places, which is precisely
# what this axis is about.
#
# Shrinking an entry is always safe -- de-duplicate onto a shared mixin or
# helper and delete the name. Growing one is the decision that deserves the
# thought.
