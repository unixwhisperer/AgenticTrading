"""Readers for the frontend static-text guards.

/app has no build step and no JS test toolchain, so its contracts are guarded by
asserting against the shipped source as text (the convention set by
test_ai_hedge_fund_frontend.py). This module is the half those guards share:
load each file once, and slice a named region out of it by brace matching.

Shared rather than copied because the slicing is where the subtle bugs live -- a
helper that returns the wrong region makes every assertion built on it vacuous,
and a copy in each test file would have to be fixed in each test file.

The three module constants are /app's files, but the scanners below take their
source as an argument: the landing guards (test_landing_*.py) slice TSX with the
same primitives, and the first copy of `match_paren` to live in one of those
files also shipped its own `//`-stripping regex that ate the second slash of any
URL. That is the failure this module's docstring is about, one directory over.

    not raise: it silently shortens the region a guard then asserts over, and
    the guard reports whatever survives. Nothing in the sources scanned today
    has a URL, so that is a trap set for the edit which adds one.

    A scanner rather than a regex, because "is this `//` a comment" is a
    question about what came before it. Two known limits, both checked against
    the files scanned today and both stated here rather than left to be
    rediscovered the way the `//` one was:

    * a regex *literal* holding an escaped slash (`/https?:\/\//`) is not
      tracked, so its trailing `\//` reads as a comment start;
    * an apostrophe in bare JSX TEXT (`<p>didn't load</p>`) opens a string that
      only closes at the next one, and any comment in between survives. Every
      apostrophe in the scanned TSX is inside a comment or a double-quoted
      string, which is safe by construction -- a comment is skipped whole,
      before quote tracking sees it.

    A file that grows either needs this taught about it, not a caller working
    around it: the caller's workaround is what this function replaced.
