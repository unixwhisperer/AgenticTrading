"""The target-shape fixtures: today's payloads plus the §9 fields the /admin page renders.

PR C ships before the contract re-cut (design §13, re-ordered 2026-09-16). The
committed fixtures under fixtures/admin_analytics/ stay today's shapes and are
validated against the committed models in test_admin_analytics_frontend.py; the
copies under target/ add the fields PR D puts on the models. This module pins
that the two sets differ by exactly those fields and nothing else, so neither
can drift from the other. PR D deletes target/ and this module together — the
second test below fails on purpose the moment a committed fixture carries a §9
field, which is that PR's signal to do so.
