"""Guards for issues #390 and #365 in ``get_leaderboard``.

**#390 — a NULL equity published as a real $0.**
``float(pt.get("equity") or 0)`` turned "nobody observed this hour" into "the
account held nothing". ``chart_equity_curve`` prepends an open tick at starting
capital, so the series read as a −100% loss, and ``align_equity_curves`` puts
every entry on one shared axis — so a single such point sets the y-range and
flattens every honest curve on the board. The fix is the wire format: the server
emits ``null`` and each surface null-fills it the way it already null-fills a
missing timestamp.

**#365 — one board, two capital bases.** The twelve published contest curves in
the committed seed database were all computed at **$100,000** (verified below,
against the file itself). ``leaderboard.json`` was later changed to
``initial_capital: 10000``, and because the cache key omitted seed capital the
two halves of the board diverged: ``auto_compute`` baselines recompute at the
new number while LLM entries stay cached at the old one. That is not a display
problem — a $10k account buys whole shares in a coarser quantum and pays
per-trade costs against a smaller base, so it is a *different run* of the same
strategy. Rescaling the dollar levels hides the difference and repairs nothing.
This branch aligns the config to $100,000, so the stored rows are correct as
they stand and no re-run is needed (#194 is blocked on LLM credits).

⚠ **Seed capital is a ranking key in the cache, never a filter, and the tests
below pin that as a spend control.** A config change that made rows *miss* would
not be quiet: ``ensure_leaderboard_runs`` answers a miss by recomputing on a
public unauthenticated GET, and ``_daily_models_status`` reports one as
*pending*, which is what ``maybe_schedule_daily_leaderboard_refresh`` acts on —
``refresh_daily_leaderboard`` then calls ``deploy_model_run`` for every
configured LLM entry. With ``LEADERBOARD_DAILY_AUTO_DEPLOY`` armed, one edit to
``leaderboard.json`` would buy a billable re-run of the whole board from an
anonymous request. ``_warn_on_capital_drift`` is the signal instead, following
``_warn_on_feed_drift``, which set that policy for the identical problem one
field over.

The frontend cases run the real extracted functions under node, following
test_frontend_leaderboard_hover.py.

    """A leaderboard database wired into the service, plus the two NULL shims.

    ⚠ **A NULL cannot be written through the normal API today**, and that is
    worth stating rather than working around silently:
    ``equity_timeseries.equity`` and ``agent_runs.initial_equity`` are declared
    ``NOT NULL`` in *both* backends (``database.py``, ``database_postgres.py``),
    and the committed seed database — which *is* prod's database — holds no NULL
    in either column today. So ``insert_equity_points`` raises rather than
    storing the shape these defects mishandle.

    That does not make the defects hypothetical, it makes the schema a *second*
    layer that happens to hold:

    * ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` never tightens an existing table, so any
      database created under a looser schema keeps it — and the committed seed
      DB is itself proof that this drift happens: its ``equity_timeseries``
      declares ``cash`` and ``positions_value`` **nullable** (the current
      ``database.py`` declares both NOT NULL), and ``get_leaderboard`` scaled
      those two columns through exactly the same ``or 0``.
    * ``get_equity_curve`` is a plain row reader with no validation, so anything
      the column can hold reaches the payload.

    These shims therefore hand ``get_leaderboard`` the rows a looser database
    would, at the seam it actually reads them through.
