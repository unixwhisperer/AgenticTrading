"""Boot-order contracts for /app: interactive before network, feedback while slow.

The boot regression this pins: the DOMContentLoaded handler used to serially
await ~12 network round trips (auth refresh, agent claim + list, deep link,
defaults, feature flags) before initNavigation() wired a single nav button and
before the ticker's first fetch was even issued. On a Render cold start that
left the page looking dead for 30+ seconds -- nav clicks silently dropped, no
loading state anywhere, ticker (the de-facto "app is ready" signal) dead last.

Guarded as source text per the convention in _frontend_source.py.
