FastAPI backend for agentic trading dashboard.
Serves equity curves, run metadata, and comparison data.

This module is the application composition root: it creates the FastAPI app,
configures middleware, registers routers, wires startup hooks, and serves the
frontend. Backend API route bodies live in ``dashboard.backend.api.routers.*``.

# lists run to hundreds of KB uncompressed; minimum_size skips tiny payloads
# where the gzip header would cost more than it saves.
#
# Added FIRST on purpose, which makes it the INNERMOST layer. add_middleware
# prepends, so the last one added wraps everything. GZip must sit below
# SessionMiddleware because that is a BaseHTTPMiddleware: it re-emits every
# response as a stream, and GZip only honours minimum_size on the non-streaming
# branch. Stacked above Session it therefore compressed *every* response
# including a 15-byte {"status": "ok"} -- inflating it and burning event-loop
# CPU -- with minimum_size silently inert (test_small_response_is_not_gzipped).
#
# compresslevel=6, not Starlette's default of 9: Starlette compresses inline on
# the event loop (no threadpool hop), so the cost is paid by every concurrent
# request -- the loop is single-threaded no matter how many cores the instance
# has, so a stall here delays every other in-flight response. Measured on a
# 462 KB equity curve, level 9 costs 25.0 ms for 20.1% of original while
# level 6 costs 6.4 ms for 20.8% -- 4x the event-loop stall to save 0.7
# percentage points.
#
# ⚠ The original argument leaned on the prod CPU being *slower* than wherever
# those numbers were taken, which amplified the stall. Prod moved to a full CPU
# on 2026-09-11, so that amplification is gone and the case for 6 over 9 is
# weaker than it was, not stronger. The ratio should survive the move; the
# absolute gap wants re-measuring on the current plan before anyone leans on it
