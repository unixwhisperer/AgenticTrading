 *
 *  Pure in (labels, gap, top, bottom) for the same reason `boardFrameLayout`
 *  is: node without a canvas is the only kind of chart test this repo has, and
 *  the defect this replaces was invisible to every source-shape guard that
 *  already existed.
 *
 *  THE BAND IS THE CANVAS, NOT THE PLOT -- that distinction IS the bug this
 *  fixes. These labels live in the gutter, to the right of `chartArea.right`,
 *  so they may legitimately hang past `chartArea.bottom` into the x-axis strip.
 *  That strip is NEARLY empty at their x, not actually empty: Chart.js centres
 *  the last x tick on `chartArea.right` and reserves its right-half overhang
 *  inside our own `layout.padding.right`, which reaches about 18px into the
 *  gutter here and 21px on screen 0's larger ticks. Scales draw before
 *  `afterDatasetsDraw`, so a label always wins those pixels rather than being
 *  occluded by one; BOARD_TICK_CLEARANCE is what keeps it from landing on top
 *  of a tick in the first place. The version this replaces clamped
 *  them to `chartArea` instead, and since the forward pass enforces a MINIMUM
 *  gap the staggered stack is routinely taller than the plot: 255.3px against a
 *  237.4px plot on the Leaderboard tab at 1440, 202.5px against 168.8px on
 *  screen 0. Two whole-stack shifts then cancelled each other exactly -- lift
 *  the tail inside, put it straight back -- and a rendered check found the last
 *  label drawn 5px past the canvas bottom on the tab and 10.4px past it on
 *  screen 0, sliced through the middle.
 *
 *  THREE PASSES. Down to open the gaps, up to pull the tail inside `bottom`,
 *  down again to push the head inside `top`. The third is not redundant with
 *  the first: the second pass is what can drive the head out, and re-running
 *  the first is what puts it back without compressing anything. Walking a bound
 *  rather than shifting the whole stack is what keeps every gap at or above
 *  `gap` -- nothing is squeezed to buy the room. */
