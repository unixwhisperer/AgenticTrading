"""Does a trading instruction actually change what the model does?

The participatory-competition design assumes instruction quality maps to return
on a pinned model. Nobody has measured it. This runs deliberately opposite
instructions through the leaderboard harness and prints the spread.

    # free: check wiring, spend nothing
    python dashboard/scripts/probe_instruction_sensitivity.py --list-instructions

    # ~$0.43: the cheap half, and decisive on its own if it passes
    python dashboard/scripts/probe_instruction_sensitivity.py \
        --models nemotron --initial-capital 100000

    # ~$4.54: only needed if nemotron comes back flat (the contingency branch)
    python dashboard/scripts/probe_instruction_sensitivity.py \
        --models deepseek --initial-capital 100000

`--initial-capital 100000` is not optional in practice. leaderboard.json currently
carries `initial_capital: 10000`, which the resolution guard below refuses (one
median DJIA share is 2.49% of equity, above the 1% ceiling) — so without the flag
these commands exit EXIT_CONFIG before spending anything. $100k is also the base
every published board curve was computed at, which is what makes a probe return
comparable with one. The flag stays explicit rather than defaulting to 100000
because the config value is the thing under suspicion; see the capital-mismatch
section of the write-up.

Cost is read off the seven published contest runs, which recorded $0.0715
(nemotron) and $0.756 (deepseek) per 160-step run over this exact window, so
six instructions cost ~$0.43 and ~$4.54 respectively. Running both is the
plan's ~$4.97 — but the gate table only needs deepseek when nemotron fails, so
`--models` defaults to nemotron alone.

Treat those as an UPPER bound, not a forecast. They extrapolate from a
default-prompt board run, and this script exercises the custom-prompt path,
which bills differently: the 2026-08-16 deepseek leg came in at $0.4556/run
against a $0.70-0.80 prediction, after an earlier prediction erred the other
way. Deliberately not lowered — an estimate that under-shoots is the one that
overspends. Read per-run cost off a measured run; see
docs/superpowers/probe-results/2026-08-09-instruction-sensitivity.md.

GATE: if the spread across these instructions is under ~1pp, the instruction
axis does not exist and Phase 2 must not be built. See the gate table in
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-participatory-competition-phase-0-1.md.

WHY A FALLBACK RUN INVALIDATES EVERYTHING: without a usable API key, every run
silently falls back to rule-based trading and produces the *same* curve. That
is a spread of 0.00pp — indistinguishable from a real "the model ignores the
instruction" result, and it would kill the design over a billing problem. Any
run that did not clear the H6 coverage threshold makes the verdict
INCONCLUSIVE (exit 3), never FAIL.
