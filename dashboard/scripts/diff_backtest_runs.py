"""Where do two backtests of one configuration first disagree?

Prints, as JSON, the first divergent bar, how many bars diverged, and the
final-equity gap between two saved runs, plus the sampling each run recorded.
Reads ``agent_runs``, ``equity_timeseries`` and ``backtest_decisions``
through the same ``db`` the dashboard uses, so it works against local SQLite
or, with ``AGENT_RUNS_DATABASE_URL`` set, against Postgres.

    python dashboard/scripts/diff_backtest_runs.py <run_id_a> <run_id_b>

**Two axes, and ``basis`` says which one answered.** The decision log is the
sharper of the two, but it is not always written: ``run_agent_backtest``
calls ``db.insert_decisions`` only on the AI Hedge Fund runtime (the guard in
``HourlyBacktester`` keyed on ``AI_HEDGE_FUND_RUNTIME_TYPE``), and the
external-agent surface (``external_run_service``) is the only other writer. A
pipeline-runtime backtest -- the ordinary dashboard run -- has no rows there,
so the decision fields come back ``None`` rather than ``0`` and the equity
curve, which every run writes, carries the number. A zero out of an empty
table is the strongest claim this script can make, and it is the one claim it
must never make by accident.

The number this exists for is *later and smaller*, not zero: providers are
not deterministic at temperature 0, and each bar's prompt embeds the previous
bar's answer, so one different draw is carried to the end of the run.
